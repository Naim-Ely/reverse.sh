# reverse.sh

Write a Bash script, reverse.sh, which reverses the contents of a directory passed as a parameter. Assuming /my/dir contains "cache cron games lib log run tmp," your program "reverse.sh /my/dir" will return "tmp run log lib games cron cache." Use an array and two functions: main() and reverse(). You will manually manipulate the list as we did today. DO NOT use the built-in command sort -r.
